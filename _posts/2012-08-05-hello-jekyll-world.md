Well let's start blogging again. I have never been a big blogger, I started it 2 to 4 times, using several blog engines like [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org) or [Tumblr](http://tumblr.com). 

All along the way I had the same problems with those engines:

- I didn't like the way I had to publish posts, because I'm not a big fan of web interfaces. I always ended up closing my browser tap and losing my content.
- Customizing was way to hard in my opinion.

But I always thought, blogging is a really nice way of sharing information with others, I was always looking for a better way of doing it. A **bunch of guys** are now using [Jekyll](http://jekyll.com) as their blogging framework, I was wondering if this could suite my needs as well. 

Here we are now.

It seems that it completely fit my needs. I can use my favorite [text editor](http://http://www.sublimetext.com) to write my posts and easy publish the whole thing with Github pages. It's quite simple.

The source of this blog is also available on [Github](http://www.github.com/gekitz/gekitz.github.com), right now there is **no reason** for me to keep it private.
